## Overview
Explore a hands-on repository focused on practical scripts and concepts in mobile robotics and ROS 2. This collection emphasizes real-world applications and strengthens core skills in robotics. The content is enhanced with additional scripts to deepen understanding and practical skills in ROS 2.

## Key Learnings
### Kinematics üßÆ
- Understanding the fundamentals of kinematics in mobile robotics.
- Implementing forward and inverse kinematics for a differential drive robot.
- Practical application of kinematic equations to control robot motion.

### Twist Message Handling üîÑ
- Publishing and subscribing to ROS 2 `geometry_msgs/Twist` messages.
- Implementing publishers to control robot velocity.
- Creating subscribers to process and respond to Twist messages.
- Combining multiple subscribers and publishers into a single script for efficient data handling and robot control.

### Publishers and Subscribers üì°
- Gained an in-depth understanding of how ROS 2 publishers and subscribers facilitate communication between nodes.
- Developed scripts to experiment with message flow, including publishing velocity commands and subscribing to feedback data.
- Combined multiple subscribers and publishers for streamlined and modular robot control.

### URDF and Bot Design ü§ñ
- Designed a robot model using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format).
- Incorporated various meshes to represent robot components, ensuring an accurate and detailed visual representation.
- Utilized URDF to define joint structures, linkages, and physical properties of the robot.
- Verified the URDF design in simulation environments for functional testing.

### Differential Drive Controller üõû
- The `diff_drive_controller` was used to smoothly translate velocity commands into wheel-specific actions, enabling reliable and precise robot movement.
- Configured the controller to interface seamlessly with the robot's hardware and ROS 2 topics.
- Utilized the controller to translate velocity commands into wheel-specific control inputs.

### Custom Simple Controller üõ†Ô∏è
- Built a custom `simple_controller` in both Python and C++ to manage robot movement.
- Designed for direct and adaptable control over the robot's velocity.
- Added features to track velocity through `joint_states` for better feedback.
- Simulated real-world conditions with a noisy controller.
- Enabled pose estimation using wheel odometry and added an `odom` publisher for localization.

### Transform Publisher and Subscriber üîÄ
- Added a transform publisher and subscriber in both Python and C++.
- Created a Python service to retrieve transform data, enabling efficient data handling and processing.

### Launch Files üöÄ
- Launch files in ROS 2 are configuration scripts that simplify starting multiple nodes or processes together.
- Created files to make it easier to start the differential drive controller for the robot.
- These launch files also initialize the robot in Gazebo Ignition, with added features to automatically adjust for the detected ROS 2 and Gazebo versions.
- Integrated the noisy controller and pose estimation functionalities seamlessly into the launch sequence.
- Created a launch file to initialize the robot in Gazebo Ignition, with added functionality to automatically detect the Gazebo version based on the ROS 2 version.
- Enhanced compatibility and support for various ROS 2 versions through dynamic version checking in the launch files.
- Modified the launch file to integrate the noisy controller and additional features seamlessly.
